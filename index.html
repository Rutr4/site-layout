            Hellraiser is a 1987 British supernatural horror film written and
            directed by Clive Barker, and produced by Christopher Figg, based
            on Barker's 1986 novella The Hellbound Heart. The film marked
            Barker's directorial debut. Its plot involves a mystical puzzle
            box that summons the Cenobites, a group of extra-dimensional,
            sadomasochistic beings who cannot differentiate between pain and
            pleasure. The leader of the Cenobites is portrayed by Doug
            Bradley, and identified in the sequels as "Pinhead".
